The Second Chapter was created using Flutter (Dart Programming) and Firebase. To use the App, please install AndroidStudio/VisualStudioCode and use an emulator. 
Clone the project by copying the gitHub link to this project and open it through the software using the gitversioncontrol option. On downloading, please "get the packages" in the pubsac.yaml file and
then run the program. If you are a new user => Register so that it gets updated to the firebase!
